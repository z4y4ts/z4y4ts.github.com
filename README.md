=================

So this is my resume. Public version is [here](http://z4y4ts.github.com/).

I maintain it in markdown -- nice and easy to read, edit & export language.

Export to HTML is provided by [GitHub:pages](https://pages.github.com/) via Jekyll.

Export to PDF I do by myself with help of [Gimli](https://github.com/walle/gimli)

Now résumé update as simple as:

1. Edit index.md.
2. Run simple command to export it to pdf. ```gimli -removefrontmatter -file index.md -outputfilename 'Alexander Zayats - resume'```
3. Push changes to github.
4. ...
5. PROFIT!
